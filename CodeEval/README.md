## About Code Eval



"[Code Eval](https://www.codeeval.com) is a platform used by developers to showcase their skills. Developers can participate in app building competitions and win cash/prizes. They can also solve programming challenges as a way to impress employers with their technical skills. Employers can use CodeEval as a way to enhance their brand by launching competitions/programming challenges and as a means to get introduced to the best developers."

## About this repository



The target is to solve as many problems as I can, and keep the time

consumed by each script below 10 seconds (at that point the script is

interrupted by Code Eval).



### Contents:



There are 3 directories, `easy/`, `moderate/` and `hard/` corresponding

with the level of the challenges in the website. Within each folder, the 

challenges are separated into the languages that were used to solve the 

problem.
